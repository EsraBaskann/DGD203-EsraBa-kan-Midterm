## Expanded Endings

### Ending A: To Help Others
**Outcome:**
The relic glows with a warm, golden light. "Your selflessness shall shape the world." A radiant energy surrounds you, and in an instant, the blight over the Forbidden Forest vanishes. Plants flourish, animals return, and the once-treacherous land becomes a sanctuary.

Back home, you are celebrated as a hero. Villages across the land experience peace and prosperity thanks to the relic's influence. Yet, the burden of knowing the relic's immense power remains on your shoulders. You wonder if it was right to wield such force, even for good.

### Ending B: To Gain Power
**Outcome:**
The relic burns with a searing crimson light. "Power you seek, and power you shall wield." A dark energy courses through you, granting unmatched strength and intellect. You rise to prominence, feared and respected in equal measure.

But with great power comes paranoia. Those you once called allies now plot against you, and the very forests you conquered begin to resist your rule. The relic whispers warnings of your eventual downfall, and its presence becomes an inescapable shadow, urging you toward ever greater ambition.

### Ending C: To Find Truth
**Outcome:**
The relic pulses with a cool, silvery glow. "The truth shall set you free—or chain you forever." Your vision blurs, and when it clears, you are shown visions of the world's creation, its hidden histories, and the forces that govern life and death.

With newfound knowledge, you uncover ancient conspiracies and hidden secrets. However, the truths are as burdening as they are enlightening. The world seems smaller, its mysteries now threads in a vast, incomprehensible web. Though you are wiser, you are left to question whether ignorance was bliss.
